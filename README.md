This script allows you to organize and clasificate your files:
1. Just put the script in the directory you want to organize.
2. Execute it.
3. It will create new destination directories (you can add or remove as you need).
4. It will move files following a relationship dictionary, example {".jpg":"Images"}.
   NOTE: the script ignores all python files... why? to not loose itself lol.
